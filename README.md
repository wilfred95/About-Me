# Hi there! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a backend developer passionate about building scalable and efficient systems. My expertise lies in Node.js, TypeScript, Docker, Postgres, MySQL, and clean architecture principles. I enjoy designing robust APIs and working with databases to create seamless applications.

While frontend development has never been my thing (thanks, CSS! 😅), I recently discovered Flutter and found it quite interesting. In fact, I've already built two projects with it!

When I’m not coding, I love playing the guitar 🎸 and exploring new technologies that improve backend development.
